                <h3>Are humans the weakest link in security? Github's SSH Keys exposed</h3>
                <h4>#humanerror</h4>
                <p>Are humans the weakest link in security? Github's SSH Keys exposed</p>
                <p>On March 24 github's ssh private keys where exposedin a public repository.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The keys where not exposed due to malicious intent of a threat actor but due to human error</p>
                <p>the private key exposure once again sums up why we should be carefull with how we treat data</p>
                <p>and double check when or what we publish to the web.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Github did not comment on who published the keys but did state the following:</p>
                <p>"This week, we discovered that GitHub.com's RSA SSH private key was briefly exposed in a public GitHub repository.</p> 
                <p>We immediately acted to contain the exposure and began investigating to understand the root cause and impact.</p>
                <p>We have now completed the key replacement, and users will see the change propagate over the next thirty minutes," <a href="https://github.blog/2023-03-23-we-updated-our-rsa-ssh-host-key/">GitHub stated in the blog post.</a></p>
				<br>
                <p>The blog post explained that the change does not affect any customer data, requires no change for ECDSA or Ed25519, or the infrastructure of GitHub only the operations "over SSH using RSA." </p>
				<br>
				<p>Due to this companies will have to check how far reaching the impact is of the keys leaking, now that some automated systems might suddenly not work especially ones that aren't checked as often.</p>

                <h3>Chat GPT a blessing or a curse for enterprises?</h3>
                <h4>AI DATA</h4>
                <p>Since more people are copying internal data towards chatgpt,</p>
				<p>we must start considering the risk of source code and protected internal documents making it out in the wild</p>
				<p>This gives threat actors another look at how a company works from the inside since most code written out by chat gpt and other ai</p>
				<p>suffers from using easy access without security in mind making it easier to breach due to credentials not being checked.</p>
				<p>Low Code/No code platforms often come with the caveat that credentials are often shared bypassing the enterprise security model.</p>
				<br>
				<p>So how do we protect against this? Straight up blocking and banning often leads to users finding work arounds.
				<p>What is needed is education on how these tools work and how they can be benificial if mock code is used and checked for security flaws.</p>
